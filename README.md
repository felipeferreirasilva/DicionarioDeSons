About: Visually impaired people do not have access to one of the main elements found in teaching materials: Images. In any textbook, the use of images is intense, because it helps the student to es- tablish the concepts and the thematic vocabulary. To help solve this problem we developed a multilingual dic- tionary that can read words and sounds matching the searched terms. For example, when searching for the word "dog," the dictionary translates the word to another idiom and play the sound of barks, which would re- place the image.
